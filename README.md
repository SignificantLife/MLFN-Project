# Applications of Machine Learning for Networking
This is one of the courses I took last semester, and I will compile some of the course results here.


## Course description:
Nowadays, machine learning is a popular field and has been widely used in several applications such as pattern recognition, computer vision, natural language processing, computer games, data analytics, etc.This new graduate-level course focuses on applying machine learning methods to computer networks research. It is specifically offered to those graduate students who want to conduct research on applying machine learning methods to computer networks.In this course, we will start with a short introduction to the ideas, methods, and current status of machine learning. Then, we will move on to study many high-quality research papers that have successfully applied machine learning to different aspects of computer networks. Students will do two labs to get hands-on experiences on using the Scikit-learn machine learning package to solve classification/prediction problems.
## Prerequisite:
1. Having taken the "Introduction to Computer Networks" course is a must.
2. Having taken the "Introduction to Machine Learning" course is a plus but not required.
3. Know how to write Python programs (or can learn it by yourself quickly)

This course is not intended to be a course that uses the whole semester to teach machine learning. Instead, its main focus is on applying machine learning to computer networks. We will only briefly present the ideas of the machine learning methods that have been applied to computer networks, and about 2/3 of the semester will be used to study how to apply machine learning to the many aspects of computer networks to solve important problems.
